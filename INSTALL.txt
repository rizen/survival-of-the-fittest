Before you install, note that this software is licensed to you under the GNU General Public License, which should be included in this distribution.

REQUIREMENTS

MySQL 3.23.x
Perl 5.6.x
Apache 1.3.x
(And perhaps a few perl modules depending on your system.)

WARNING: If you try to install this on Windows (which, I'm not even sure will work) you'll have to rename the "aux.pl" file to something else, because "aux." is reserved in Windows systems.


INSTALL STEPS


Step 1. Unpack the archive. You've probably already done this if you're reading this.


Step 2. Create the database:

mysql
create database sotf3;
create database citygen;
grant all privileges on sotf3.* to sotf@localhost identified by 'sotf';
grant all privileges on citygen.* to sotf@localhost identified by 'sotf';
flush privileges;
quit

Note: If you want to change any of this info you can, but you need to edit it in utility.pm as well.


Step 3. Load the database:

mysql -usotf -psotf sotf3 < sotf3.sql
mysql -usotf -psotf citygen < citygen.sql


Step 4. Set up your Apache web server to point to the "public" directory. You will probably want to enable mod_perl to make the game really fast. Your config may look like this:

<VirtualHost *>
DocumentRoot /data/domains/yoursite.com/sotf/public
ServerName sotf.yoursite.com
ServerAlias www.sotf.yoursite.com
  <Files ~ "\.(pl)$">
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
  </Files>
 DirectoryIndex index.pl
</VirtualHost>


Step 5. Go to the site and test it. Log in as "Admin" with a password of "123qwe".


Step 6. You can get to the admin functions by going to http://www.sotf.yoursite.com/admin.pl
